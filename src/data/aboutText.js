			'My Catholic Faith is of utmost importance to me. After studying Theology, I went on to complete my Masters of Counselling and Psychotherapy. My passion is for the Sacrament of Marriage. I have assisted married couples through my counselling. I have a great desire to assist Catholic singles with skills that will benefit them greatly when they enter their vocation. This is the way I hope to intervene before there are issues in a marriage or even in a religious vocation.',
